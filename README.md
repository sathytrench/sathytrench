## ANAHIT GULIAN // SOFTWARE ENGINEER

Hi! I'm an artist, writer, and engineer living in NYC. I attended the Grace
Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy from fall 2020 to winter 2021,
completed a software engineering apprenticeship at [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com/) from 
spring 2021 to winter 2022, and now work as a software engineer for [Civiqs](https://civiqs.com/).

I grew up allergic to the computer (but very into videogames), went to school for creative 
writing, and spent some time in New York's poetry and printmaking worlds. 
Around 2016, I decided I wanted to take all my experience with storytelling, visual art,
and music and funnel it into designing games. So far, I've done two projects, Concrete World 
and RegExtris, using the Phaser.io game-making framework. [Concrete World](https://concrete-world.netlify.app/) 
is my baby, my first foray into Phaser. It features my own hand-drawn art and pixel sprite animations. 
[RegExtris](https://regextris.netlify.app/), built with my friends from the Grace Hopper Program, 
is a Tetris clone that lets players practice and improve their RegEx skills. 
(It's way more fun than RegExr, I promise!)

Outside of coding, I love writing short stories, printmaking, finding cool anime/manga/games/music 
to absorb, and exploring the weird nooks and crannies of New York. I hope to meet 
more people who want to use coding to create strange and beautiful things!
