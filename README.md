## ANAHIT GULIAN // SOFTWARE ENGINEER

Hi! I'm an artist, writer, and engineer living in NYC. I attended the Grace
Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, where I learned as much JavaScript as I 
could while being blasted with the fire-hose of fullstack developer education
(including Express, Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, and Sequelize). Currently
I'm a software engineering apprentice at [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com/),
where I've been learning a lot more about Git, Ruby-on-Rails, and React Native.

I grew up allergic to the computer (but very into videogames), went to school for creative 
writing, and spent some time in New York's poetry and printmaking worlds. 
Around 2016, I decided I wanted to take all my experience with storytelling, visual art,
and music and funnel it into designing games. So far, I've done two projects, Concrete World 
and RegExtris, using the Phaser.io game-making framework. [Concrete World](https://concrete-world.herokuapp.com/) 
is my baby, my first foray into Phaser. It features my own hand-drawn art and pixel sprite animations. 
[RegExtris](https://regextris.herokuapp.com/), built with my friends from the Grace Hopper Program, 
is a Tetris clone that lets players practice and improve their RegEx skills. 
(It's way more fun than RegExr, I promise!)

Outside of coding, I love writing short stories, printmaking, finding cool anime/manga/games/music 
to absorb, and exploring the weird nooks and crannies of New York. I hope to meet 
more people who want to use coding to create weird and beautiful things!
