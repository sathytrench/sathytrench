## ANAHIT GULIAN // SOFTWARE ENGINEER

Hi! I'm an artist, writer, and engineer living in NYC. I attended the Grace
Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, where I learned as much JavaScript as I 
could while being blasted with the fire-hose of fullstack developer education!

I got into coding because I wanted to make games. I've done two projects,
Concrete World and RegExtris, using the Phaser.io framework. I also love
adding my own hand-drawn art and pixel sprite animations into games. Outside
of coding, I love writing short stories, finding cool anime/manga/games/music 
to absorb, and exploring the weird nooks and crannies of New York.
