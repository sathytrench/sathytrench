## ANAHIT GULIAN // SOFTWARE ENGINEER

Hi! I'm an artist, writer, and engineer living in NYC. I attended the Grace
Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, where I learned as much JavaScript as I 
could while being blasted with the fire-hose of fullstack developer education
(including Express, Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, and Sequelize)!

I grew up being very allergic to the computer, going to school for creative 
writing and being very determined to make things with my own hands. But a couple 
of years ago I decided I wanted to make my own games using me and my friends' artwork. 
So far, I've done two projects, Concrete World and RegExtris, using the Phaser.io framework. 
Concrete World is my baby, my first foray into Phaser. It features my own hand-drawn art 
and pixel sprite animations. RegExtris is a group project, a Tetris clone also built in Phaser
that lets players practice and improve their RegEx skills (it's way more fun than RegExr, I promise!)

Outside of coding, I love writing short stories, printmaking, finding cool anime/manga/games/music 
to absorb, and exploring the weird nooks and crannies of New York. I hope to meet 
more people who want to use coding to create weird and beautiful things!
